<user_query>
how to print man page without pager
</user_query>

<response>
You can print a man page without a pager by using the `-P` option with `man`, followed by `cat`. The `-P` option is used to specify the pager program.

```bash
man -P cat <command>   # usage
man -P cat make        # example
```
</response>

Remember to keep your output short and to the point. Max 300 words.
